# Overview

This is an interactive escape room challenge web application built as a single-page HTML game. The project creates an immersive puzzle-solving experience with a vibrant cyberpunk aesthetic, featuring dynamic animated gradients in bright colors (magenta, purple, cyan, yellow), neon effects, and retro typography. The application includes an engaging FPL Trophy mystery storyline and comprehensive sound effects. Users solve three sequential riddles to "escape" while being timed.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page application**: Built entirely in vanilla HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Responsive design**: Uses CSS flexbox and viewport meta tags for mobile compatibility
- **Visual theme**: Cyberpunk aesthetic with dark gradient backgrounds, neon accent colors (#e94560), and monospace fonts
- **Layout structure**: Centered container design with maximum width constraints for optimal viewing

## Styling Strategy
- **CSS-in-HTML approach**: All styles are embedded within the HTML file for simplicity and portability
- **Color scheme**: Vibrant theme with animated gradients using bright colors (magenta #ff006e, purple #8338ec, cyan #3a86ff, yellow #ffbe0b, mint green #06ffa5)
- **Typography**: Courier New monospace font for retro computer terminal appearance
- **Visual effects**: Extensive animations including rainbow text gradients, pulsing containers, shimmer effects, and glowing borders
- **Sound integration**: Web Audio API for interactive sound effects (button clicks, correct/incorrect answers, victory fanfare, timer ticks)

## Game Logic Architecture
- **Client-side only**: No backend server required, runs entirely in the browser
- **Progressive disclosure**: Likely implements puzzle progression through JavaScript state management
- **Immersive UI**: Full viewport design with centered game container and atmospheric styling

# External Dependencies

## Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Base markup structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, shadows, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity (implementation not visible in provided code)

## Browser APIs
- **Standard web APIs**: Relies on modern browser support for CSS3 features like gradients, box-shadow, and flexbox
- **No external libraries**: Self-contained application with no third-party JavaScript frameworks or CSS libraries

## Hosting Requirements
- **Static hosting**: Can be deployed on any web server or static hosting service
- **No database**: All game state managed client-side
- **No server-side processing**: Purely frontend application
