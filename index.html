                        Your team finds a cassette player nearby and inserts the tape to play. But you hear nothing but
                        static noise.
                        Just before the tape click off, the detective's voice whispers from the front:
                        <br>
                        <i>
                            They erased it all. But I managed to retrieve one thing... the day they gave up.
                        </i>
                        <br>
                        A soft mechanical click echoes across the room from behind you. You turn. A drawer labeled
                        ARCHIVE---Case 404 has popped open just slightly --- but still held shut by a 4-digit lock.
                        <br>
                        Above it, pinned to a corkboard, is a torn page from an old calendar:
                        <br>
                        <i>
                            03/18
                        </i>
                        <br>
                        Beneath the date, in faded ink:
                        <br>
                        <i>
                            They stopped digging that day.
                        </i>
                        <br>
                        Taped to the front of the drawer is a folded note:
                        <br>
                        <i>
                            When justice faded into grey,
                            <br>
                            The date was marked, then swept away.
                            <br>
                            Reverse the month to change your view,
                            <br>
                            Then take the day and subtract it too.
                            <br>
                            The answers lie in what you've seen---
                            <br>
                            Place them side by side to glean.

                        The drawer opens with a heavy groan.
                        No files. No codes. Just a stack of old notepads, most of them blank - except one.
                        Near the top, a page has clearly been torn out.
                        But when you tilt it under the light... there are faint pressure marks left behind - as if
                        someone wrote something on the page above.
                        <br>
                        A small note is stuck nearby with a paperclip:

                            A hidden note beneath the plain.
                            <br>
                            Don't shine a light - it won't appear,
                            <br>
                            but darkness makes the writing clear.
                            <br>
                            Drag the black across the sheet,

                        As soon as you rub the charcoal on the page, the message appears. But wait, it just says, "Dig".
                        Along with your team, the detective investigates the CCTV footage, interviews the groundskeeper,
                        and pieces together the
                        facts. He then lets you to the big playground where the trophy was last seen, and the finals was
                        to be held.
                        <br>
                        After a bit of thinking and looking around, he asks the caretaker to brink some shovels, and
                        asks your team to dig just below the trophy stand. With the hope that you are almost there, you
                        & your team start digging.
                        <br>
                        After a few minutes of digging, you hit something hard.
                        <br>
                        It's a vault! But it's locked with a 3-digit numeric combination lock. You clean the front of
                        the
                        vault,
                        and find a scribble saying:

                        It appears that the password is a number that is reduced by the amount 495 if it's digits are
